# Copy Orders for Any Computer via Internet Slave

This code is a sample implementation of a MetaTrader 5 Expert Advisor that allows you to copy orders from a master computer to a slave computer via the internet. It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and can be used to enhance your forex trading efficiency.

## Global Variables

- `server_IP`: IP address of the master computer.
- `server_Port`: Port number of the master computer.
- `isConnected`: Flag to track the connection status.

## Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is called when the Expert Advisor is initialized. It establishes a connection to the master computer by calling the `ConnectToServer()` function.

## Copy Orders Function

The `CopyOrders()` function is responsible for copying orders from the master computer. If the connection to the master computer is successful, the code to copy orders should be implemented in this function. Upon successful copying, a success message is printed. If there is no connection to the master computer, an error message is displayed.

## Modify Orders Function

The `ModifyOrders()` function is used to modify the stop loss and take profit levels of the copied orders. Similar to the `CopyOrders()` function, it checks the connection status and performs the necessary modifications. A success message is printed upon successful modification, and an error message is displayed if there is no connection.

## Close Orders Function

The `CloseOrders()` function is responsible for closing the copied orders. It follows the same structure as the previous functions, checking the connection status and performing the necessary actions. A success message is printed upon successful closure, and an error message is displayed if there is no connection.

## Connect to Server Function

The `ConnectToServer()` function is called by the `OnInit()` function to establish a connection with the master computer. The actual code to establish the connection should be implemented in this function. Upon successful connection, the `isConnected` flag is set to true.

## Expert Advisor Start

The `OnStart()` function is called when the Expert Advisor starts running. It sequentially calls the `CopyOrders()`, `ModifyOrders()`, and `CloseOrders()` functions. After completing these actions, it sets the `isConnected` flag to false to disconnect from the master computer.

## Expert Advisor Deinit

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the Expert Advisor is deactivated or removed. It sets the `isConnected` flag to false to ensure disconnection from the master computer.
